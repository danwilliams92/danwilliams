					<p class="p-2">So I'm based in South Wales, not too far from Cardiff.<br>
						I have a Bachelor's Degree in Music (I'm a classical guitarist by trade), and initially wanted to teach privately after University.
							I wanted my own professional website to get more clients, but couldn't afford to pay for one - so I decided to teach myself.
						After seeing how awesome and rewarding it was to build your own website however, I changed my career focus entirely and now want to use my time and skill to work on Web Development!
					</p>
					<p class="p-2">
						I only started to learn about six months ago, and because I work full-time AND am a father to two naughty kids, I do not have an abundance of time to learn and work on projects.
						However, I am fairly happy with the progress I have made so far, all things considered, and I am keen to learn as much as I can.

					<p class="p-2">Although my work so far has only manifested in the form of projects (as opposed to real-world websites made for clients), I still try to take methodical steps in the process.</p> 
					I follow these guidelines when working on my projects:
						<ul class="list-group" id="process-list">
							<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Gather information</span>. Decide what product or service the website wants to offer, who their target audience(s) is/are, and how I can model the website towards these people</li>
							<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Look to other functioning websites</span> that are offering a similar service - see what they have going for them and what they're missing or could be doing better (that I could use in my website)</li>
							<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Produce physical sketches</span> of how I could present and organise the website in desktop, mobile and tablet formats. Make a note of what features they might use.</li>
							<li>Get together suitable, good-quality <span class="font-weight-bold">images</span> for the website; select an appropriate <span class="font-weight-bold">typography and colour scheme</span>, as well as appropriate icons if needed</li>
							<li>Produce the <span class="font-weight-bold">markup, styling</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">javascript</span> for the website</li>
							<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Test</span> the appearance and functionality of the website on <span class="font-weight-bold">various browsers</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">device dimensions</span>. Ask myself if I can make changes to <span class="font-weight-bold">improve</span> the user's experience</li>

				<div class="col col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-lg-8 col-xl-8">
				<p class="p-2">Over the next year, I'd love to work as a Web Developer full-time!<br>
				I want to gain a stronger understanding of vanilla Javascript, more PHP knowledge, a better understanding of Git and the Command Line, possibly a CMS (viz. WordPress), and after that perhaps a JS framework/library such as React.
				For the meantime however I don't want to rush in to the newest shiny technology without being confident with the fundamentals (which I think is wise, right?).
				</p>
				<p class="p-2">Long-term, I'd like to be working on large-scale websites and web applications as part of a team - but I'll think about that after I've found my feet as a junior developer.</p>
